       <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
       <p>My old college roommate was the one who originally taught me about this recipe. It is super easy and
        flavorful due to the ground beef sauce. The hardest part of the recipe is gathering the ingredients. This 
        recipe is so easy to meal prep, if that's something you are interested in. I would pair with white rice, I like
        the sticky consistency of white rice compared to brown rice, but you can use whatever carb you prefer. I also
        like to make airfried broccoli covered in the same sauce as the ground beef. I feel it makes the dish cohesive
        but any vegetable will work if you like it. Overall, this dish is easy, yummy, and perfect for someone looking for 
        easy and healthy.
