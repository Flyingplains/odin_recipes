   <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
   <p>This recipe is from Jacques Pepin's book <em>Quick and Simple.</em>This recipe simply is quick and simple and tastes FANTASTIC. 
    It is a recipe I use multiple times once a week. Using 6 ingredients and only one sheet pan makes clean up -the worst part am I right?- 
    a breeze. I like to pair the chicken with a vegetable, such as Roasted Butternut Squash or Maple Balsamic Brussel Sprouts, and a carb
    like, Garlic Parmesan Pasta or Mushroom Rice. </p>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <p><ul><li> 4 skinless chicken thighs </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Panko seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dijon style mustard</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 425. Prep the chicken thighs by sprinkling salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons
        olive oil and arrange the legs on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Bake for 15 minutes. The 
        chicken will only be partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the remainin 1 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil to the breadcrumbs and mix together. </li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oven, brush the surface with the mustard, and pile the breadcrumbs on top,
        pressing lightly to make them adhere.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the breadcrumbs are brown and
        and the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Transfer the legs to individual plates and serve immediately.
